I recently finished reading an (test!) <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2011/05/18/anatomy-of-an-a-a-look-inside-the-process-of-one-of-the-worlds-most-efficient-studiers/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+StudyHacks+%28Study+Hacks%29" target="_blank">article</a> by Cal Newport over at Study Hacks on <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/" target="_blank">Scott Young's</a> study process.  While not revolutionary (and some might even make a bad joke about vegetarianism) his habits do bring some refreshing points.

Two points stand out to me,

> If you can’t explain something simply, it means you don’t fully understand it.

<tooltip title="Keep It Simple Stupid">KISS</tooltip> is a principle held highly in engineering of all forms and is a principle I embrace wholeheartedly.  I think it would be difficult if not impossible to find an example that goes against this point.

Of course sometimes the decision on whether something is simple or not is quite subjective but I think his point is still sound regardless.  Simplicity is a form of beauty, so while you may not think http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GgOn66knqA

If you've read <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=4825" target="_blank">The Little Schemer</a> then you'll know this book attempts a very unique style of technical writing.  The Little Schemer has very little traditional text.  Instead the book asks and provides a list of questions and answers covering a wide range of possible thinking towards the problem.  People I've talked to who have read this book find this a very effective way of understanding the text in front of them, and even beyond understaning but remembering the concepts.

> Is (null? l) true or false
> where
>   l is (a b c)
>
> False,
>   because l is a non-empty list.

<br />

> Is (atom? (cdr l)) true or false
> where
>   l is (Harry)
>
> False,
>   because the list () is not an atom.

In fact, in the books 210 pages the author thought this technique was so effective, that he only included "traditional style content" in the form of just over a dozen introductory sections.  It's hard to argue with the results given that The Little Schemer is read by both Stanford and MIT students additionally to receiving <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RMRQUQPH2J4GB/ref=cm_cr_dp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262560992&nodeID=283155&tag=&linkCode=" target="_blank">positive reviews</a> from people such as Douglas Crockford.
